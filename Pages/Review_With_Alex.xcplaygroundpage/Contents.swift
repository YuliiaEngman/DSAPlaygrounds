 Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

 Example 1:

 Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
 Output: 5
 Example 2:

 Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
 Output: 4
 Note:
 You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.

 // 2. Now I want to loop through characters in string and check what value that character has in dict, it value equals 1 I want to return indext of that character in string
 // but also we should return index of the character

 // aha! First time made a mistake - because if there will be o single character I will not get correct unswer with following code:
 
 var index = -1

 Collection Types - Array Exercises

 Question 1

 Create an array of strings called colors that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

 Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String "orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors".

 Solution:
 */


let colorArray = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavander"]
print("\(colorArray[0]), \(colorArray[1]), and \(colorArray[4]) are some of my favorite colors")

/*
 
 Question 2

 Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

 var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]

 Solution
 */
  var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
westernStates.removeLast(2)
print(westernStates)
 
 
 /*
 Question 3

 Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not in the continental United States.

 let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]

 Solution
 Question 4

 Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in myString:

 let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"

 Solution
 Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

 let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]

 Solution
 Question 5

 Iterate through garden and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the basket. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with "dirt". Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your basket.

 var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
 var basket = [String]()
 Solution
 Question 6

 The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. You, the coach, need to make some last minute changes:

 Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
 Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
 Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
 Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.
 var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]

 Solution
 Question 7

 Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.

 (The built-in contains(_:) function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)

 var numbers: [Int]

 let target: Int = 32
 Ex.1

 numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

 target = 32

 //true
 Solution
 Ex. 2

 numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

 target = 3

 //false
 Solution
 Question 8

 Find the largest value in an array of Int. Do not use the built-in max() method.

 let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

 //This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
 Solution
 Question 9

 Find the smallest value in an array of Int. Do not use the built in min() method.

 let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

 //This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
 Solution
 Question 10

 Iterate through secondListOfNumbers, and print out all the odd numbers.

 var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]

 Solution
 Question 11

 Iterate through thirdListOfNumbers, and print out the sum.

 var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]

 Solution
 Question 12

 Iterate through thirdListOfNumbers, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

 var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]

 Solution
 Question 13

 Append every Int that appears in both listOne and listTwo to the sharedElements array. Then print how many Ints are shared.

 Assumption: both arrays are of equal length.

 Constraints: you cannot use Sets

 var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
 var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
 var sharedElements = [Int]()
 Solution
 Question 14

 Write code such that noDupeList has all the same Ints as dupeFriendlyList, but has no more than one of each Int.

 Constraints: you cannot use Sets

 var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
 var noDupeList: [Int] = []
 Solution
 Question 15

 Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

 let arrayOfNumbers = [-6, 13, 0, 34, 0, 45, -12, 9, 11, 4]

 Solution
 Question 16

 If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

 Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
