Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.
 

Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

func firstUniqChar(_ s: String) -> Int {
    
    let uniqStr = s.un
    
    for char in
    
}

 Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

 You may return the answer in any order.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
 Output: ["e","l","l"]
 Example 2:

 Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
 Output: ["c","o"]
